📊 Super Forecasting with Bayesian Statistics

🎯 Project Title

Forecasting High-Stakes Global Events Using Bayesian Reasoning

Course Project – SCH-MGMT 650: Statistics for Business, UMass Amherst

🧠 Overview
This project applies Bayesian statistical modeling to forecast outcomes of three high-uncertainty, high-impact scenarios:

England’s advancement in UEFA Euro 2024

Probability of a lethal confrontation between Russia and the U.S. before Dec 2024

Likelihood of the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 43,000 by end of 2024

Using a combination of prior probability estimation, current data modeling, scenario adjustment, and posterior probability calculation (via Nate Silver’s formula), the project illustrates the application of Bayesian updating in complex real-world decisions.

🧮 Methodology
Bayesian Priors from historical data (e.g., UEFA rankings, past DJIA growth rates)

Inside Views from current performance indicators, geopolitical trends, and macroeconomic forecasts

Probability Updates based on weighted evidence

Black Swan Risk Modeling

Posterior Probabilities calculated using Bayes’ Theorem + external influence adjustment

🔍 Scenario Insights
⚽ England in Euro 2024
Prior: UEFA 2nd-ranked teams have a 75% chance to reach QF

With current team performance & injury-free status, adjusted posterior = 73% (QF), ~40% (Final)

🧨 Russia–US Confrontation
Prior: 1% chance based on historical nuclear conflict use

Given international organization efficiency and sanctions, posterior decreased below 1%, classified as “Almost Impossible”

📈 Dow Jones > 43,000 by End of 2024
Prior: 30% based on past 30-year YOY increases

Factoring in GDP, S&P 500 trends, and global uncertainty, posterior = 41.15%, labeled “Chances About Even”
